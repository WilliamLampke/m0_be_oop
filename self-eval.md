# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It feels like I have a great grasps of the basics programming in any language which is a victory, it felt nice to quickly knock out problems, and mainly getting stuck on syntax shenanigans!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Super well! I will usually go until I feel like I need a break, and taking that break helps me regain focus and energy to keep moving.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need my workspace to continue being clean and organized, and support from my peers and friends irl!
